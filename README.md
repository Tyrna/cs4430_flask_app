# Project

This is a web front-end, database application for class CS4430.
The web application itself will be run using Flask, hosted under AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Hosting of the application will be turned off after application has been submitted.

### AWS Elastic Beanstalk

As of 3/4/2019, the url to access this application is: http://flaskapp-env.ph5f4wwvzp.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

In order to apply changes to this development environment, a zip file needs to be created with the application itself and the required dependencies.
After, it must be uploaded on AWS interface and deployed from there until automation arrives.
